# Dotfiles

My dotfiles I am using. It has a dependency on Arch.

It uses Ansible as automation. I have multiple machines and they get different configs. I achieve this by naming the machines
and running the script based on host name.

Running:
1. Copy config.skeleton to config and change the vars as needed
2. run  `./dotfiles.sh` to let it run

I'll add more information as I please. **Please do not run this script. It is tailored to my setup.**

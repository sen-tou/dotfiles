# Dotfiles

My dotfiles I am using. It has a dependency on Arch.

I have multiple machines and they get different configs. I achieve this by naming the machines
and running the script based on the arch.

Running:

1. Copy config.skeleton to config and change the vars as needed
2. run  `./dotfiles.sh` to let it run

I'll add more information as I please. **Please do not run this script without checking what every moving part does. It is tailored to my setup.**
